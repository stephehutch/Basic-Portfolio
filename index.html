               In 2009 the infant mortality rate in the Fifth Section was 50%.  The Fifth Section St. Marc, Haiti that is largely ignored by the government.  The people there are a welcoming tight-knit community who never hesitate to smile and say hello to any stranger they pass on the street. I remember walking from mud house to mud house inviting people to a free clinic down the street.  During my walk, I met a woman with an infant clinging to her breast. The child did not look like an invalid except for his curly red hair.  His hair should have been black, but malnutrition had changed it to a vibrant shade of orange. With a 50% infant mortality rate I knew that this child’s chances of seeing his second birthday were slim to none. I felt hopeless because there was absolutely nothing I could do to help this child.

              I try to adhere to philosophy that a business can have more purposes than simply the accumulation of wealth.  I would be a good addition to the program because I can offer a fresh perspective due to direct experience with people in underdeveloped countries.  I have seen firsthand what a community looks like with a total lack of commerce. A business can build a community from the ground up. I couldn’t do anything to help that baby, but with an advanced degree, I could learn more about how a functioning economy works from the perspectives of three different developed economies.

              <p> While studying abroad at Germany’s WHU I discovered that for two developed countries, it is surprising how differently Germany and the United States handle economics. Germany has a high income tax and does not have a minimum wage, while the US has a minimum wage, but has a relatively low income tax. Studying abroad in Germany and helped me to learn a different way an economy or business can function. Someday, I hope to apply this knowledge in developing economies.

                <p>  I have had this dream of transforming a community through entrepreneurship since I was young. I started visiting developing nations at the age of twelve. Right away I saw the need for commerce. On my trip to the Philippines we went to a beach side village. I didn’t know why at the time, but the children there had highlights as well, and only one woman in that entire village had a job. I’ll never forget the looks on their faces as I waved goodbye from the back of the Jeep. A few years later, I went back to that village and met a woman who remembered me from last time I was there. She showed me a picture of my face waving out the back of the Jeep. Through this experience I learned I can make a difference.  I hope that a furthering my education with a will give me the knowledge and experience necessary to make a difference in not one just person’s life, but the lives of an entire community.

            As a parting note, I am happy to report that since I last visited Haiti the infant mortality rate has halved. As the world economy develops more places like the fifth section are getting access to clean water and healthcare. Unfortunately, economics as force for change also has an ugly side. That sea-side village In the Philippines is now being threatened by a corporation that wants to build a casino.
